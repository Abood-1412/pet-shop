# App Features
1. **User Authentication:** Secure session-based login and signup system.
2. **CRUD Functionality:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete pets they have added.
3. **Authorization:** Only the creator of a pet can edit or delete it; guests can browse pets without modifying data.
4. **Responsive UI/UX:** A cohesive visual theme, accessible color palette, and intuitive navigation for first-time users.
5. **Future-Ready Design:** Structured to allow additional features, such as adoption requests, pet categories, or admin functionality.

# User Stories:
1.**Guest User**

    As a guest user who is not logged in, I want to be able to view a list of pets available for adoption so that I can browse them without needing an account. I also want to view detailed information about each pet, including their name, type, age, description, and image, to learn more about them. Additionally, I want the option to sign up and create an account so that I can manage pets and interact more fully with the app. Finally, I want to be able to log in using my email and password to access my account and its features.
   
2.**Registered User**

    As a registered user, I want to be able to add pets for adoption so that other users can see them. I also want to edit the pets I created to keep their information up to date and delete any pets that are outdated or no longer available. Additionally, I want to view a list of pets I added to manage them easily, as well as browse pets added by other users to consider for adoption. I want to be able to log out securely to ensure my account remains private. Importantly, I should only be able to edit or delete pets I created so that the data of other users is protected.

3.**Admin**

    As an admin, I want to have the ability to edit or delete any pet in the system to maintain an accurate and up-to-date database. Additionally, I want to be able to view and deactivate users as needed to ensure that the community remains safe, organized, and well-managed.

4.**Add New Items**

    As an admin, I want to add new items to the catalog so that I can keep the shop updated with fresh products.

5.**Edit Existing Items**

    As an admin, I want to edit details of existing items (e.g., price, description) so that the information remains accurate and current.

6.**Delete Items**

    As an admin, I want to delete items from the catalog so that I can remove products that are no longer available.

7.**View All Categories**

    As a user, I want to view all available categories on the site so that I can explore the diversity of products offered.
